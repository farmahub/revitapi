# 🏗️ RevitAPI Snippets

Welcome to **RevitAPI**, a curated collection of Python snippets for automating tasks in Autodesk Revit using the Revit API (via RevitPythonShell or pyRevit). This repository is designed as a personal toolbox of practical mini-scripts that streamline common modeling, documentation, and management workflows in Revit.

## 🚀 Purpose

This project is meant to:
- Serve as a **reference library** for frequently used Revit API patterns.
- Enable **faster prototyping** of automation tools in daily BIM workflows.
- Help **learn and experiment** with Revit’s .NET-based API in a Pythonic way.

## 📂 Structure

The repo will grow over time and may include scripts such as:

- ✅ Selecting and filtering elements
- ✏️ Creating walls, lines, levels, dimensions
- 🔍 Inspecting element parameters
- 🧹 Deleting or cleaning unused elements
- 📄 Managing views, sections, tags, filters, and more

Each script is written with readability in mind and includes comments for learning and clarity.

## 🛠️ Requirements

- Autodesk Revit (tested on versions 2021+)
- [pyRevit](https://www.notion.so/pyRevit-Documentation-6cdb5ffcf0d243b480793f4f9f95d0f0) or [RevitPythonShell](https://github.com/architecture-building-systems/revitpythonshell)
- Python scripts assume they are running within Revit’s Python interpreter (not standalone)

## 📎 Usage

These scripts are intended for use in the **pyRevit environment**:

1. Install pyRevit.
2. Clone this repository or copy desired snippets.
3. Paste code into pyRevit script buttons or run directly in the Python console.
